# 👁️ Retina Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **data analysis and machine learning case study** focused on
classifying retinal diseases from fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate an **end-to-end analytical workflow** —
from data understanding and preprocessing to model evaluation — within a medical imaging context.

This project emphasizes **data analysis, model evaluation, and result interpretation**,
rather than clinical deployment.

## 🎯 Business & Analytical Context
Early detection of retinal diseases is critical to prevent vision loss.
However, manual inspection of fundus images:
- Requires significant expert time
- Is prone to subjectivity and variability

From a data perspective, this project explores how image data can be:
- Processed and structured for analysis
- Evaluated using performance metrics
- Interpreted to understand model behavior and limitations

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach
This project follows a structured analytical pipeline:

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Reviewed class distribution and image characteristics
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Image resizing, normalization, and train-validation splitting
3. **Model Development**
   - CNN-based image classification model
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and loss comparison
   - Confusion matrix analysis
5. **Result Interpretation**
   - Identification of class-level performance strengths and weaknesses

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:
- Training vs validation accuracy
- Training vs validation loss
- Confusion matrix

The evaluation focuses on **understanding model behavior**, potential overfitting,
and misclassification patterns rather than achieving maximum accuracy.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - TensorFlow / Keras  
  - NumPy, Pandas  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **publicly available retinal fundus image dataset**
sourced from Kaggle.

This project is conducted as a **learning and portfolio case study**.
The focus is on analytical methodology, evaluation, and interpretation,
not on dataset collection or clinical usage.

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways (Data Analyst Perspective)
- Image data requires careful preprocessing to ensure consistent input quality
- Evaluation metrics and confusion matrices provide critical insight beyond accuracy
- Model analysis helps identify class imbalance and performance trade-offs
- Medical image classification presents both analytical opportunities and limitations
